DATA MANAGEMENT
#################################################

log using name_of_log
start a log file that will record commands and results tables. Use "log close" at end of do file to close the log file.

delimit ;
set semicolon as end-of-line delimiter in do file. Stata will not consider a line finished until it encounters a semicolon. Allows you to not have to end every line break with ///. Turn off with #delimit cr. (This must end with a carriage return)

append using olddata
reads previously-saved dataset olddata.dta and adds all its observations to the data currently in memory
save newdata, replace will save the combined datasets as newdata.dta

browse
opens data browser

browse boats men if year > 1980
opens data browser showing only boats and mean vars for years greater than 1980

compress 
converts all variables to their most efficient storage type

drawnorm z1 z2 z3, n(5000)
create a dataset with 5000 obs and three random vars sampled from std normal dist'n

drop from dataset any variables that have missing values for every obs.
dropmiss, obs drops any observations with missing values for all obs

edit
open data editor

mvdecode var3-var62, mv(97=. \ 98=.a \ 99=.b)
for variables var3 through var62, recode the numerical values 97, 98, and 99 as missing.
If only one missing value is required, we can instead specify an option such as mv(97 98 99=.)

replace oldvar = 100 * oldvar
replaces values of oldvar with 100 times their previous values

sample 10
drops all obs in memory except for 10% random sample
sample 55, count would drop all but a random sample of size n=55.

save newfile
saves data currently in memory as newfile.dta in working directory.
save newfile, replace writes over previous version.

sort x
sorts data from lowest to highest values. Obs with missing data appear last after sorting because Stata views missing numbers as very large numbers. (see also gsort)

tabulate x if y > 65
frequency table for x using only those obs that have y values above 65.

use oldfile
retrieve previously-saved Stata-format dataset oldfile.dta.
use oldfile, clear will open oldfile.dta and clear current dataset in memory without saving

#################################################
FITTING CURVES
#################################################
three broad approaches to modeling nonlinear or curvlinear relationships
- nonparametric: lowess smoothing and band regression 
- linear regression with transformed vars (Box Cox)
- nonlinear regression

boxcox y x1 x2 x3, model(lhs)
finds MLE of lambda for a box-cox transformation of y, assuming y is a linear function of x1, x2 and x3 and has constant-variance errors. model(lhs) restricts transformation to the left-hand-side var y.

graph twoway mband y x, bands(10) || scatter y x
produces y vs x scatter plot with line segments connecting the cross medians (median x, median y points) within 10 equal-width interval bands.  This is one form of band regression. Can use 'mspline' in place of 'mband'

graph twoway lowess y x, bwidth(.4) || scatter y x
draws a lowess smoothed curve with a scatterplot of y vs x. Lowess calculations use a bandwidth of .4 (40% of the data)

lowess y x, bwidth(.3) gen(newvar)
draws a lowess-smoothed curve on a scatter plot of y versus x, using a bandwidth of .3. Offers more options than graph twowy lowess

nl (y1 = {b1=1}*{b2=1}^x
uses iterative nonlinear least squares to fit a 2-parameter exponential growth model: b_1*b_2^x. b1 and b2 are bound in braces with their suggested starting values

nl log4: y x, init(b0 5 b1 25 b2 .1 b3 50)
fits a 4-parameter logistic growth model 

regress lny x1 sqrtx2 invx3
performs curvlinear regression 

#################################################
ROBUST REGRESSION
#################################################
If errors are normal iid, OLS is more efficient than any other unbiased estimator. If errors are not normal iid, then other unbiased estimators might outperform OLS. Robust regression methods aim to achieve almost the efficiency of OLS with ideal data and substantially better-than-OLS efficiency in non-ideal situations (ie, non-normal errors)

rreg y x1 x2 x3
performs robust regression of y on three predictors, using iteratively reweighted least square with Huber and biweight functions tuned for 95% Gaussian efficiency.

rreg y x1 x2 x3, nolog tune(6) genwt(rweight) iterate(10)
performs robust regression of y on three predictors. The options tell Stata not to print the iteration log, to use a tuning constant of 6 (which downweights outliers more steeply than the default of 7), to generate a new var (named rweight) holding the final-iteration robust weights for each observation, and to limit the max number of iterations to 10.

qreg y x1 x2 x3
performs quantile regression, aka least abs value (LAV) or minimum L1-norm regression of y on three predictors. By default, qreg models the conditional .5 quantile (approximate median) of y as a linear function of the predictor variables, and thus provides "median regression".

qreg y x1 x2 x3, quantile(.25)
performs quantile regression modelling the conditional; .25 quantile (first quantile) of y as a linear function of x1, x2 and x3

bsqreg y x1 x2 x3, rep(100)
performs quantile regression, with SEs estimated by bootstrap data resampling with 100 repetitions (default is rep(20))

predict e, resid
calculates residual values (arbitrarily named e) after any regress, rreg, qreg, or bsqreg commands. Similarly, predict yhat calculates the predicted values of y. 

regress y x1 x2 x3, vce(robust)
performs OLS regression of y on three predictors. The coefficient var-covar matrix, and hence SEs, are estimated by a robust method (Huber/White or sandwich) that does not assume identically distributed errors.

SURVIVAL AND EVENT-COUNT MODELS
#################################################


#################################################
MULTILEVEL AND MIXED-EFFECTS MODELING
#################################################

xtmixed crime year || city: year
mixed-effects regression of crime on year, with random intercept and slope for each value of city. Thus we obtain trends in crime rates, which are a combination of the overall trend (fixed effects), and variations of that trend (random effects) for each city

xtmixed SAP parentcoll prepcourse || city: || school: grades
Fits a hierarchical or multilevel mixed-effects model predicting student's SAT scores as a function of (1) fixed or whole-sample effects of whether the individual student's parents(s) graduated from college, and whether the student took a preparation course; (2) random intercepts representing the effect of the city in which they attend school; and (3) a random intercept and slope for the effect of individual students' grades, which could be different from one school to the next. Individual students (obs) are nested within schools, which are nested within cities. Note the order of the mixed-effects parts in the command.

xtmixed y x1 x2 x3 || state: x4
estimates store A
xtmixed y x1 x2 x3 || state:
estimates store B
lrtest A B
Conducts LRT of null of no difference in fit between the more complex model A (which includes a random slope on x4) and the simpler model B that does not include a random slope on x4. This amounts to a test of whether the random slope on x4 is statistically significant. Order of models in test does not matter.

xtmixed y x1 x2 x3 || state: x4 x5, ml nocons cov(unstructured)
performs mixed effects regression of y on x1, x2 and x3; also on random effects x 4a and x5 for each value of state. Obtains estimates by maximum likelihood. The model should have no random intercept, and an unstructured covariance matrix in which random-effect variances and covariances all are estimated distinctly.

estat recov
after xtmixed, displayes the estimated variance-covariance matrix of the random effects.

predict re*, reffects
after xtmixed estimation, obtains best linear unbiased predictions (BLUPs) of all random effects in the model. The random effects are stored as varaibles names re1, re2 and so forth, with appropriate variable labels.

predict yhat, fitted
after xtmixed estimation, obtains predicted values of y. To obtain predictions from the fixed effects portion of the model only, type predict yhat, xb. Other predict options find SEs of the fixed portion (stdp) and residuals (resid) or standardized residuals (rstan). 

xtmelogit y x1 x2 || state:
performs mixed-effect logit regression of {0,1} variable y on x1 and x2, with random intercepts for each level of state.

predict phat
after xtmelogit, obtains estimated probabilities from the complete (fixed plus random) model. 

xtmepoisson accidents x1 x2 x3, exposure(persondays) || season: || port: , irr
estimates mixed-effects poisson model for accidents, a count of accidents on fishing vessels. Fixed-effect predictors, characteristics of individual vessels, are x1 x2 and x3. Exposure is measured by the number of person-days at sea for that vessel. We include random inetrcepts for each season or year, and for port city nested within seasons. Report fixed-effect coefficients as incident rate ratios (irr).

gllamm warming sex race educ age class, i(region) family(binomial) link(ologit) adapt
perfoms generalized linear latent and mixed modeling - in this example a mixed-effects ordered logit regression of ordinal variable warming, opinion about global warming, on fixed-effect predictors sex, race, educ, age, and class. Includes random intercepts for each value of region. Estimation by adaptive quadrature. The family() and link() options can specify other models including mulinomial logit, probit, ordered probit and complementary log-log. gllamm is not an official program supplied with Stata (as of version 10)
